Excel-based data cleaning and analysis of top concert tours using a dirty dataset from Kaggle.
This project explores a dirty dataset of top-grossing concert tours using Excel. It focuses on cleaning messy data, analyzing artist frequency, identifying outliers, and examining correlations between shows and earnings.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Taylor Swift and Madonna dominate with 4 tours each.
- The Eras Tour is a clear outlier with $14M per show.
- More shows ≠ more money—lean tours outperform.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Dataset: [Dirty Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/martinkanju/dirty-dataset-to-practice-data-cleaning)

## 📈 Future Work
- Expand dataset to include mid-tier artists
- Use Power BI/Tableau for dashboards
- Forecast earnings with regression models
